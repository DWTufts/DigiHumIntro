But strangest of all\\nwas the power of the old Negro woman who\\nlived in the house. From this eerie dwelling at\\n1661 Octavia Street in San Francisco, the\\nshrewd and crafty Negress whom the world\\nknew as Mammy Pleasant, ruled not only the\\nThomas Bel) family for whom she ostensibly\\nworked, but half the politicians in the State of\\nCalifornia. Even a governor came under her\\nstrange power—a power that she carried with\\nher to her grave.\\nIntrigue coupled with mystery from time im\\nmemorial has captured the attention of people.\\nThere is an elusive fascination about whomso\\never or whatsoever is shrouded in the cloak of\\nthe unknown. Suspense is exciting—the more\\nsuspense and the longer it is sustained, the more\\nexciting. That\\'s why the story of Mammy Pleas\\nant is still told today. Mammy is long since\\ndead, but the strange tales of mystery and scan\\ndal connected with her, walk like ghosts in the\\nminds of the curious. Those who have heard\\nher story are still in suspense—kept guessing\\nat her secrets, which were the source of her\\namazing power.\\nThe story of Mammy begins 88 years ago,\\nat the time when the often-heard rumors that\\ngold had been discovered in California becamfe\\nfact, and untold thousands seeking fortune\\nflowed like endless streams into the West.\\nIn the eventful year of 1848, there arrived\\nin San Francisco a young woman, Mary Ellen\\nPleasant—quick wiited, shrewd and alert—who\\nwas destined to become a notoriously well\\nknown character, not only in the gold rush days\\nbut throughout the remainder of the nineteenth\\ncentury. She was the “Mammy” Pleasant who\\nbecame one of the West’s most colorful figures\\na forceful woman to whom power far super\\nseded wealth in importance. Both power and\\nwealth came to her through her ability to find\\nout things about the great and the near great\\nand to keep their secrets. Her story is one of\\nunfathomable intrigue, packed full of amazing\\nincidents, each flavored with its mystery, its\\nsuspense, and its baffling denouement.\\nBorn at Boston, in August 1814, Mary Ellen\\nWilliams was the illegitimate child of a free\\nLouisiana Negress and a Cherokee Indian. She\\nwas dark skinned, but mainly, her features were\\ndominated by her Indian blood, having the\\nprominent cheek bones, a high-bridged nose\\nand well-formed lips. Her eyes, however, were\\nastonishing! One was blue and the other brown!\\nHer childhood was most unhappy and wretched.\\nShe begged on the streets. She was forced to\\ncommit petty crimes and live mostly by her\\nwits. In her twentieth year, Lady Luck smiled\\non her, and she met and married a well-to-do\\nfree Cuban Negro named Alexander Smith. At\\nthe time of his death in 1844, his estate totalled\\n$45,000, which he left to Mary Ellen with the\\nstipulation that some of this money be used\\ntoward furthering the Abolition Movement\\nwhich was then sweeping over the country.\\nTwo years after his death, Mary Ellen\\nIntrigue! Mystery! Tragedy! Death! Horror!\\nTyrant Was John Brown’s Aide\\nagain married, and this time it was one John\\nPleasant, a former employee of the deceased\\nSmith. With him, she arrived in San Francisco\\nearly in 1848. For a short time they lived to\\ngether, but soon he dropped out of her life,\\nprobably because he couldn’t figure very attrac\\ntively in her plans for the future. It is known\\nthat he died, and also that he was not mourned.\\nShrewd as she was, it was only natural for\\nher to quickly take advantage of the many op\\nportunities to make a fortune that the early\\ngold rush days in San Francisco offered. Being\\na splendid cook, she was in great demand and\\nit was not long before she was offered as much\\nas five hundred dollars a month for her serv\\nices.\\nShe decided, instead, to open a boarding\\nhouse for bachelors. Finding a house on Wash\\nington Street, she lavishly furnished it, and had\\nas regular boarders and guests such men as\\nNewton Booth, Sharon, Broderick, Terry and\\nscores of other rising men of the moment Her\\nfame spread, and it was necessary as well as\\nprofitable for her to open other houses of less\\npretensions and less respectability. For it must\\nbe said of Mammy that she not only set a fine\\ntable but she also arranged with finesse all man\\nner of entertainment —from cards and an occa\\nsional highball to female companionship. She\\nknew the tastes of her male boarders, and sup\\nplied them quickly and efficiently. Through such\\ntactics she intimately knew all the private in\\ndiscretions of these wealthy and prominent gen\\ntlemen, all of which gave her a tremendous\\namount of power. Money rained down upon her.\\nIt was common gossip that Mammy Pleasant\\nhad decided that San Francisco was not to be\\na city without women. Hence many houses ca\\ntering to less elite and cheaper trade, were ac\\ntually hers, but which she openly did not\\nacknowledge.\\nWhile busy with her own fortunes, Mammy\\nhad not forgotten the stipulation of her first\\nhusband to aid the slaves of America. She had\\na genuine interest in securing their freedom,\\nnot only as a cause, but also for the Negro as\\na race. In 1858—10 years after her arrival in\\nSan Francisco, she went to Boston, met John\\nBrown and gave him a check for $30,000 which\\nhe was to use toward obtaining arms and am\\nmunitions and completing plans for the revolt\\nof the Negroes against their owners.\\nDisguised as a jockey, sometimes in other\\nways, Mammy went South, going from planta\\ntion to plantation, from state to state, organ\\nizing and converting Negroes to the cause, help\\ning them escape to the North and Canada, via\\nthe underground railway, and giving them food\\nand money to get across the Mason-Dixon Line.\\nAll of this effort went for naught. John Brown’s\\nraid at Harper’s Ferry in October 1859 was\\npremature. He had not gotten in touch first\\nwith Mammy as he had agreed. He Was cap\\ntured, tried and hanged and an active search was\\nmade to find his accomplices. Consequently,\\nMammy was forced to flee to New York where\\nshe hid out for a time.\\nIT IS interesting to know that Mammy could\\nneither read nor write, although she did learn\\nto sign her own name. In one of John Brown’s\\nThe Fatal Stair\\nway in the House\\nof Thomas Bell\\nat 1661 Octavia\\nStreet.\\nThomas Frederick Bell,\\nWho Two Years After\\nReceiving a Substantial\\nSettlement Was Penniless\\nand Sold Apples on San\\nFrancisco Street Corners.\\npockets was found a note, the message of which\\nwas in one handwriting, and the signature,\\n“M. E. P.” in another. The message read, \"The\\nax is laid at the root of the tree. When the\\nfirst blow is struck, there will be more money\\nto help.”\\nDisillusioned with her efforts to reform, this\\nended, so far as is known. Mammy’s anti\\nslavery activities. Eventually, she returned to\\nSan Francisco to resume management of her\\nhouses.\\nSoon Mammy had dozens of then powerful\\nfinancial and political barons dancing at the end\\nof a string. They were her puppets and when\\nshe pulled the strings they moved as she di\\nrected. Such a network of interlapping evidence\\ndid she have against the political powers of the\\nState that she could indirectly influence dozens\\nof men whom she had never met. She figured\\nprominently in many police cases in which she\\ninvariably cams out victorious.\\nThere was one case in which a Negro hench\\nman of hers was hailed into court for perjury.\\nWhen the case seemed to be going against him,\\nMammy jumped from her seat in the courtroom\\nand openly announced to the court that he\\ncould not be sent to prison. She warned the\\njudge that if convicted, the man not only would\\nnever serve a day in prison, but that the judge’s\\nown career on the bench would be at an end.\\nThe frightened judge, of course, had no alterna\\ntive after this outbreak and with the evidence\\nas it was. The man was convicted and sen\\ntenced. But Mammy was right! Before he even\\nentered the gates of the prison, he received a\\npardon. The judge soon dropped into oblivion.\\nSuch was Mammy’s power.\\nMammy’s house of ill repute at 920 Wash\\nington Street was a favorite rendezvous for the\\npolitical and socially prominent men of the time.\\nMammy cared for and educated an illegitimate\\ndaughter of a one-time California governor, fol\\nlowing the mother\\'s death. The Negress saw to\\nit that the girl’s father contributed so gener\\nously that there was enough to promote other\\ncausss than his daughter’s. In his will, the gov\\nernor. then retired to private life, left his daugh\\nter. without acknowledging her as such, a share\\nof his estate. Feeling that she had not been\\nleft her just due, the girl, at the instigation of\\nMammy, contested the will, won her case and\\nobtained a handsome settlement. There were\\nother cases—many of them—but Mammy is\\nmore closely identified with the Bell family\\nthan any other.\\nFOR years, a frequent visitor to Mammy’s\\nhouses was a Scotchman, Thomas Bell. who.\\nprevious to his arrival in San Francisco in\\nhis early thirties, had held banking positions in\\nLondon and South America. A shrewd and\\ncanny financier, he organized the brokerage firm\\nof Bell and Baron, which was the agent for the\\nRothschilds of London and Paris. Later. he be\\ncame the power behind Ralston in the Bank of\\nCalifornia in the Comstock days It was he. too,\\nwho promoted and built the Guatemala or Cen\\ntral American Railway. His fortune was es\\ntimated to run between 15 and 20 million dol\\nlars.\\nThomas Bell had never married. He enjoyed\\nthe free and easy life he had led without the\\nhampering bonds of matrimony. An inveterate\\ngambler, he made and lost fortunes at one sit\\nting without batting an eye As he reached 50,\\nhe was attracted to a protegee of Mammy’s, a\\ngirl employed in one of Mammy\\'s houses, whose\\nbeauty brought down the most devoted atten\\ntions from many of the wealthy men of the\\ncity. Mammy was quick to see that Thomas\\nBell was interested in this girl, and as a result\\nengineered her plans so successfully that he\\nmoved Teresa Clingan-Harris-Percy into his\\nhome and permitted her to add his name to\\nthe long list already hers.\\nNot long after, Mammy herself moved in\\nwith them, and straightway took a firm hand\\nin ruling the domain. She planned an elaborate\\nhome for the couple at 1661 Octavia Street.\\nEvery detail of Mammy’s plans was carried out,\\nfrom the mansard roof, to the circular stair-\\nThomas Bell, Multi-\\nMillionaire, Paid\\n$50,000 to His Wife\\non the Birth of Each\\nChild. Rumor Has\\nIt That Mammy\\nPleasant \"Ran In”\\nTwo Extra Children\\nto Collect Money\\nfor Bell’s Wife.\\nvflay extending from the basement to the attic,\\nand the lavish ballroom lined with mirrors from\\nfloor to ceiling.\\nIt was Mammy who manipulated the mar\\nriage between Thomas and Teresa after they\\nhad begun life in .their new home—that is, a\\nmarriage ceremony performed by Father Bres\\nlin. a Catholic priest, but a ceremony for which\\nno civil license had been obtained.\\nAlmost immediately there Ensued a vehement\\nquarrel between the newly-married pair, which\\nterminated’in Teresa’s hasty departure from the\\nhouse with bag and baggage. Bell had her ar\\nrested and returned and from then on they lived\\nin a divided house she on one side and he on\\nthe other, with Mammy as the intermediary.\\nAlone in his side of the house Thomas Bell\\nbrooded. If he had children his life would be less\\nlonely. But he was not on particularly good\\nterms with his wife. Mammy plotted with him.\\nIt was decided that with each child Teresa pre\\nsented to Bell, she was to receive a cash settle\\nment\\' of $50,000. As speedily as the laws of na\\nture allowed, she produced six children—three\\ngirls, Robina May, Muriel and Marie Teresa —\\nthree boys, Reginald, Eustace and Thomas Fred\\nerick.\\nAfter Thomas Bell’s death great controversy\\narose among his direct heirs over his will. It\\nwas taken to court time and time again. In the\\ntrial during September 1897, Mammy testified,\\nthat Thomas Frederick and. Marie Teresa Bell\\nwere not Teresa Clingan Bell’s own children.\\nThat Thomas Bell had brought these children\\nas babies to the ranch where Mammy lived and\\nasked her to care for them a year before\\nThomas Bell had married Teresa. This testi\\nmony all the more backed up the ugly rumors\\nwhich had circulated throughout the years that\\nall six children had not been borne by Teresa,\\neven though she was crafty enough to have col\\nlected a cool $300,000 on them, from her hus\\nband.\\nTHROUGHOUT Mammy’s career, it is evident\\nthat she not only directed and enjoyed steer\\ning the Bell family\\'s various intrigues among\\nits different members, but she took an especially\\nkeen delight in arranging the affairs of others\\nas well.\\nIn 1875, Senator Sharon became the enemy of\\nThomas Bell when he secured the control of the\\nBank of California after its failure. Probably\\nas a means of revenge, Mammy introduced\\nSharon to Sarah Althea Hill, who immediately\\nbecame Sharon’s mistress. Growing tired of her\\nrather quickly, he tried to disentangle himself\\nfrom the liaison, with the result that Sarah\\nAlthea filed suit against him in which she pro\\nduced a marriage certificate to back up her\\nclaims. She lost her case. It was common gos\\nsip that Mammy Pleasant had spent SIOO,OOO of\\nThomas Bell’s money in backing her protegee.\\nAfter the trial Sarah Althea was courted by\\nher attorney, the former Judge Terry They\\nmarried. A feud arising during the trial between\\nTerry and Justice Fields culminated in the death\\nof Terry, who was shot down by one of Fields’\\nhenchmen. Sarah Althea Hill lost her mind, and\\nit was Mammy who stepped in, to instigate pro\\nceedings whereby the unfortunate Althea was\\nplaced in an asylum.\\nIn the meantime, Thomas Bell was growing\\nold, and weak, and feeble, with frequent faint\\ning spells and attacks of vertigo. Mammy re\\nmained with the family, deftly managing the\\nlarge household, doing the marketing each\\nmorning and engineering quarrels among the\\nnearly-grown children.\\nAt a late hour one night in October 1892,\\nThomas Bel) was found sprawled out in the\\ncourtyard unconscious. He had apparently fallen\\nfrom the balcony three flights above He died\\nwithout regaining consciousness. A red shawl\\nbelonging to Mammy was found in extremely\\nclose proximity to where he met his death, and\\nwhen the servants went to Mammy’s quarters\\nto arouse her. she immediately appeared at the\\ndoor erttirely clothed despite the fact that the\\nrest of the household had been in bed for hours.\\nPolice suspected that Bell had not accidentally\\nfallen from the balcony, but the case was al\\nlowed to drop.\\nIt is coincidental that four years later,\\nThomas Frederick Bell met with an accident\\nwhich was almost the exact duplicate of that\\ncausing the death of his father. He fell over\\nthe bannister of the circular stairway from a\\nhigh point down into the courtyard below. For\\nseveral days he lay unconscious and was bed-\\n\"Strange, Unnatural Things Happened There”—the \"House of Mystery,\"\\n1661 Octavia Street, San Francisco.\\nridden for a period of eight or ten weeks. Was\\nMammy’s sinister influence behind either of\\nthese “accidents”? No matter what question\\nwas put to Mammy when she took the stand\\nin frequent court sessions, she was always\\nshrewdly able to clear her own name and es\\ncape any penalty of the law.\\nIN THE sensational court hearing in 1897, at\\nthe time Thomas Frederick, known as Fred\\nBell, sought to have Teresa Clingan Bell re\\nmoved’ as guardian of his minor brothers and\\nsisters, alleging incompetency, the trial brought\\nout the startling statement that neither he nor\\nhis sister, Marie Teresa, were Mrs. Bell’s chil\\ndren. However, their father had named them\\nspecifically in his will as his own, and whether\\nor not they were actually his blood children\\nor adopted was not determined. Mammy up\\nheld Mrs. Bell in her statement that only* four\\nchildren had been born to her. She appeared in\\ncourt and took her oath on it.\\nAt the hearing Fred Bell brought a jeweler\\ninto court who testified that Mammy had left\\ndiamonds valued at SIOO,OOO, the property of\\nMrs. Bell, with him for safekeeping. The wit\\nness stated that Mammy came for the jewels\\nsoon after Thomas Bell’s death. Another wit\\nness testified that he had kept laces valued at\\nmore than SSOOO for the Bells. Both said their\\ndealings had been direct with Mammy. But\\nMammy made satisfactory explanations to the\\ncourt as to the disposal of these valuables, and\\nthe hearing came to naught.\\nFred Bell managed to get himself into one\\nscrape after another. There was one in par\\nticular with Alphonso Barillas, son of Guate\\nmala’s president, in a questionable house on\\nBush Street, in which he was seriously injured,\\nbut no specific charges were brought, and the\\nshroud of mystery that screened all occurrences\\nin which Mammy had a hand settled over the\\nincident.\\nSome years later, following the deaths of both\\nMrs. Bell and Mammy, the Bell estate was un\\nder litigation for many years. It was only in\\ncomparatively recent years, after investigations\\nthat reached from San Francisco to Peru, to\\nChina, and back again had been made, that the\\ncourt divided the estate. But the Bell family\\nwas a strange menage, and Fred Bell strangest\\nof all. In less than two years after receiving\\na substantial settlement, Fred was seen penni\\nless on a San Francisco street corner selling\\napples. He died shortly after in a home for the\\npoor.\\nDuring the years Mammy Pleasant lived with\\nthe Bells in the “House of Mystery” on Octavia\\nStreet, many strange things went on behind\\nclosed doors. Lights burned at all hours. Shad\\nowy figures came and went. From whence they\\ncame, and where they went, their identity, no\\none but Mammy knew, and Mammy never\\ntalked. Following Mammy’s death, the old man\\nsion became virtually a \"haunted house.” Pass\\nersby claimed they often saw a strange light\\nthrough the cracks of the boarded doors and\\nwindows late at night, and Mammy’s ghost was\\nbelieved to haunt the house. The house was\\nfinally torn down.\\nMammy, before her death, quarreled vio\\nlently with Mrs. Bell and left her to go to\\nfriends in Oakland who looked after Mammy\\nuntil she died at the age of 92. She was prac\\ntically penniless when she died. There were no\\nrelatives—no heirs. She provided for a tomb\\nstone and her dying wish was that on it be\\ncarved, “She Was A Friend of John Brown.\"\\nThere were many who breathed easier with\\nMammy’s passing.\\nMary Ellen Pleasant was a character unique.\\nShe was the friend of all those whom she felt\\nworthy of her good graces. At the same time,\\nshe could have made life extremely uneasy for\\ndozens of the State’s most prominent figures\\nwhose lives she knew intimately. But her policy\\nwas always silence. She was paid, and hand\\nsomely, for what she knew, but it was the\\npower and not the money that intrigued her.\\nIt is remarkable and amazing that a woman\\nwith a heritage so meager could rise to such\\ngreat heights of power and influence—even\\nthough in so many respects it was evil and\\nsinister.\\nA black woman who determined the destiny\\nof white men was Mammy Pleasant. She was\\nborn to rule, and rule she did, not unlike a\\nqueen from her \"palace\" on Octavia fetreet—\\nthe \"House of Mystery.”\\nCopyright. 1956'}, {'title': 'imperial valley press.', 'city': ['El Centro'], 'date': '19251228', 'raw_text': '2\\nSOCIETY AND CLUE NEWS\\nESTHER RALSTON\\nAND HUBBY WILL\\nBE GUESTS HERE\\nFollowing their recent marriage\\nwhich was announced in a Holly\\nwood dispatch in Saturday\\'s Press,\\nMr. and Mrs. George Webb Frey\\nare expected i.i tins city today\\nfrom Riverside.

But the distinction yet remained\\nthat the early settlers, or those who had\\ncome to the West before \\'49, should con\\nstitute a class, with class privileges. As\\na result of the removal of the barrier\\nagainst the men of \\'49 the membership of\\nthe society was doubled before the end of\\nthe year.\\nDaring Vigilantes Led by\\nWilliam T.

In those days of\\nrestless money getting, when San\\nFrancisco was, at its best, a very\\npoor place in which to live,\\nwhen gamblers and murderers elbowed\\nrespectable citizens into the gutters, and\\ncrime in all its hideous shapes, was rife,\\nthe fraternal spirit of the society acted as\\na counter-irritant to the demoralizing in\\nfluences of the time. To the man, wearied\\nby the hurry and confusion of early San\\nFrancisco life and sick for the noble com\\nradeship of a good man the society of\\nfered the safest refuge. . While gambling\\ndens and dance balls were nightly offer\\ning their tawdry attractions to the young\\nman, wearied by the day\\'s tail, the rooms\\nof the society were the only \\'safe haven.\\nL.

To realize the\\npart which these men played in the early\\nhistory of California we have only to re\\nflect that the names of four of them have\\nbeen perpetuated by being applied to four\\nof the streets of San Francisco. Bry\\nant afterward became the author of one\\nof the earliest books on California life,\\nentitled \"What I Saw In California.\"\\nFrom its very inception the society\\ncame to command the respect and honor\\nof all. In the monster procession which\\nwas held to celebrate the news of the re\\nception of California into the Union, Colo\\nnel Stevenson, the grand marshal, placed\\nthe Pioneers In the fore-front of the line.\\nAgain, at the occasion of its first public\\ncelebration, the society marched through\\nthe streets and afterward kept open\\nhouse, entertaining State and city digni\\ntaries with a lavish hand. Well could the\\nsociety claim for itself pre-eminence at\\nthat time. Among 1 the first members_were\\nthe following noted men in subsequent his\\ntory: General Henry W. Halleck, Gen\\neral William T. Sherman, General John C.\\nFremont, General John W. Geary, General\\nGeorge A. Stoneman, General Henry M.\\nNaglee, General Joseph Hooker, Commo\\ndore Robert F. Stockton,* Commodore Sel\\nfridge—all men who either had become\\nfamous or were destined to achieve great\\nmark in the Civil War.\\nAs the society grew older, it began to\\nbecome evident that if its membership\\nwere confined strictly to the men who\\ncame to California before 1849 it would\\nsoon cease altogether, so the movement\\nto Incorporate members who were in the\\nland of gold before California was admit\\nted to the Union began to be agitated.\\nStrange to us of the present day appears\\nthe jealousy which was maintained by the\\nfirst settlers against the argonauts.

Before \\'43 there\\nwere stirring events which tended to weld\\nthe first American settlers Into a compact\\nbody with a common cause and common\\nneeds. In the days of the Bear Flag revo\\nlu\\'.ion at Sonoma, which are touched upon\\nin another part of this paper, and in the\\nfierce heat of the ensuing conquest of\\nCalifornia by General John C. Fremont\\nand .ommodore R- F. Stockton, the men\\nbanded together in support of their new\\nhomes and their mother country far over\\nthe mountains sowed the seed from which\\nwas to cpring the great society. To the\\nvery earliest blood of the society, organ\\nlz< i by these earliest settlers, there was\\ninfused the new stock of the argonauts.\\nFrom these two branches sprang the or\\npnnization which was to do so much in\\nsupport of the patriotic sentiments of\\nthe later generation— the native children\\nof California.\\nAmong those who were the very earliest\\nFettlers in the territory of California were\\ntwo who did much to inaugurate the so\\nciety, Samuel Brannan and Colonel Jona\\nthan D. Stevenson. Brannan had come\\naround the Horn in 1846 with the Mormon\\ncolony which had Intended to find In Cali\\nfornia an abiding place for the Saints, so\\nrecently driven out of their city of Nau\\nvoo.

The Mormons found that\\nthe settlers from the East had already\\npre-empted the country, but they made\\nthe best of It and stayed in the new ter-\\nThus, with their work wel\\' established,\\nthe Pioneers who yet remain look back\\nupon that which has been of their doing\\nand justly feel that they have tried to\\nperform their full measure of private\\nduty and oubllc benefaction, and leave\\na fair measure of good to the new Cali\\nfornia whose growth has been so greatly\\nstimulated by. their effort*,\\nand have to call upon the assistance of\\ntheir brothers. As an example of what\\nIs done by the relief fund the figures of\\ndisbursements for\\'the last two years\\nmay be cited.\\nThe total disbursements for relief In\\n1901-02 were $10,234. equal to an average\\npayment of JS55. For 1902-03 th» total\\nrelief offered amounted to $11,320 90, mak\\ning an average monthly payment of 1344.\\nForty-seven worthy beneficiaries claimed\\nassistance in 1901-02, and In the succeed\\ning year the number was forty.\\nThe finances of the Pioneers, thanks\\nto the generosity of James Lick and the\\nperfect management of the funds since\\nthe time of the society\\'s lnceotlon. are\\nIn such a condition as to warrant the gen\\nerous assistance given members in dis\\ntress. As the result of wisely invested In\\nterests, the assets of the society were\\nvalued at $335,843 06 at the last report of\\nthe treasurer. With such a firm founda\\ntion, the organization Is In a position to\\nrival many benevolent and fraternal so\\ncieties with far greater membership.\\nIn the museum of Pioneer Hall there is\\na rich store of historical material in the\\nshape of valuable documents, quaint me\\nmentoes of the early days and pictures\\nof prominent personages of lone ago.\\nAlong the walls of the assembly hall and\\nmuseum are hung the engravings of\\nevery president of the organization, from\\nHoward, the first, down to Henry B.\\nRuss, the incumbent Forty-five mem\\nbers of the society have thus been hon\\nored: They are: William Davis Merry\\nHoward, Samuel Brannan, Jacob Rink\\nSnyder, Stephen Randall Harris, Thomas\\nOliver Larkln, Alexander Gurdon Abell,\\nPhilip Augustln Roach, Henry Martin\\nGray, Owen Paul Button, Wlllard Brig\\nham Farwell, Joseph Webb Wlnaaa,\\nPierre Barlow Cornwall, Robert Joyce\\nTiffany, William Rufus Wheaton.

The first important step which\\nwas made after the new building had\\nbeen put into use was the creation of a\\nrelief fund. Already some of the earlier\\nmembers were becoming infirm with age\\nand many were broken in fortune. With\\nthe generous gift of 1500, made by Rob\\nert J. Tiffany, the relief fund soon grew\\nto the $10,000 mark and since that time\\nhas been kept at that sum, notwithstand\\ning the many deeds of charity which have\\nbeen done by the society for the benefit\\nof needy members.\\nOn October 3. 1S73. Lick made another\\ngenerous gift to the society of which ; he\\nwas an enthusiastic rr-ember. This was\\na deed to the magnificent site where Pio\\nneer Hall now stands on the corner of\\nFourth and Stevenson streets. Lick had\\ndesired that his name and the fame of\\nthe organization should be perpetuated\\nby a building which should be a lasting\\nmonument to both. In September,\\n1S73, Lick made the Pioneers one of his\\nresiduary legatees In the deed of trust\\nthrough which the final disposition of his\\ngreat estate was to be made. By these\\ntwo benefices that capitalist and philan\\nthropist put the Society of California\\nPioneers in the position of being one of\\nthe richest social organizations of the\\nState.\\nHoused in Magnificent\\nQuarters, Destiny Is\\nFulfilled.\\nY ICK died on September 30, 1876.\\n/ and great trouble was destined to\\nJ-^ surround the munificent gift which\\nhe had made before the society could\\nderive any benefit therefrom. When\\nIn 18S2 the society had not yet\\nreceived Its benefice from the \"Lick\\nTrust,\", which was closing up the es\\ntate, a committee was appointed to in\\nvestigate the affairs of the executors and\\nreport to the society. This committee\\nmade some sensational charges against\\nthe executors of the estate and a remark\\nable degree of excitement was aroused\\nboth in the society and by the public\\npress. * But it was fairly shown to the\\nsociety that all the time that the Lick\\nbenefice was tied up in the estate It was\\ngathering larger and larger accretions of\\nwealth. When the\" estate was finally set\\ntled in 1S0C, the cash benefit to the so\\nciety amounted to JG04.65J OS.\\nBefore the Lick estate had been di\\nvided, the agitation for a . new Pioneer\\nHall, to be erected on the lot which Lick\\nhad presented to the society in 1873. was\\ncommenced. After considerable opposi\\ntion, a permanent building committee was\\nselected and after first relncorporatlng\\nunder, the new constitution, work upon\\nthe present structure, was commenced.\\nThe cornerstone was laid on September\\n7, 1S84. and in due season the society en\\ntered into its^ permanent home. Since\\nthat time the old Pioneers have been loy\\nally standing shoulder to shoulder, clos\\ning the gaps as they are made by the\\nhand of the reaper and resolutely foster\\ning the same old spirit which obtained\\nwhen first the young Pioneers marched\\nat the head of the procession on the first\\nAdmission Day celebration.\\nThe purposes for which the Society of\\nCalifornia> Pioneers was formed and is\\nmaintained are thus succinctly stated In\\nits constitution:\\n\"The society is designed to be a moral,\\nshould take a number and thus sink his\\npersonality for the sake of the secrecy\\nnecessary to successfully carry on the\\nwork which had to be done. >\\nImmediately the question arose: \"Who\\nshall be number one?\" At once Coleman\\n-was singled out by his associates. Cole\\nman vainly tried to refuse, but at last\\nwas forced to acquiesce. Thus was the\\nstrength of the Pioneers represented in\\n\"No. 1\" of the famous Vigilance Com\\nmittee of \"56.\\nAt this time a man was elevated to the\\npresidency of the society whose name is\\nInseparable from the early history of\\nCalifornia. This was Thomas O. Larkln.\\nHe had come to Monterey in 1S32, being\\ntherefore one of the very first Americans\\nto settle in California. As consular agent\\nof the United States during the time when\\nour Government was making manifest\\nplans to lay hold of the western coast, he\\ndid much. He was a worthy representa\\ntive of the old order of things among the\\npioneers.\\nDuring Larkin\\'s presidency the entire\\nboard of directors was made up of forty,\\nniners, he being the sole representative of\\nthe old conservative first settlers. From\\nthis time forward, the younger branch of\\nthe society remained in control almost to\\nthe total exclusion of the old guard.\\nThe first headquarters of the society\\nwere In the old Bella Union building, on\\nWashington street, near Kearny. This\\nwas then the center of the business dis\\ntrict of the city, and the building in\\nwhich the Pioneers lodged was considered\\na remarkably fine one. In 1860, however,\\nJames Lick made his first gift to the so\\nciety in the form of a lot on Montgomery\\nstreet, near Pacific, where now can be\\nstill seen a dingy old hall, at present the\\nheadquarters of a livery stable, with the\\nlegend, Pioneers, across its stone front.\\nAs a result of one of San Francisco\\'s\\ngreat .fires, , which ruined hundreds and\\nparalyzed business temporarily, the So\\nciety of -California Pioneers languished\\nduring the early \\'60\\'s. But through the\\nearnest endeavors of O. P. Sutton, Wll\\nlard B. Farwell and William R. Wheaton,\\ninterest was revived in 1S62. By the plan\\nof having numerous individuals take out\\nlife memberships, a fund of $3000 toward\\nthe erection of the building upon the lot\\ndonated by Lick was accumulated.\\nThrough Gifts of James\\n/Lick, Society Gains\\nPalatial Home.\\nrllE society was then forced to de\\nvise means for placing a mortgage\\non its property in order that\\nmore building funds could be raised.\\nNo sufficient authority for such ac\\ntion being vested in the officers,\\nit became necessary to have an act\\npassed by the Legislature bestowing upon\\nthe president, \\' secretary and board of di\\nrectors the necessary authority for such\\na step. Wlllard B. Farwell, who was at\\nthis time one of those most active in com\\npleting the reorganization of the society,\\n\\' secured the passage of the act, and the\\nmortgage was given. To provide against\\npossible contingencies of a like nature,\\nthe society drew up articles of Incorpora\\ntion and on January 28, 1S63, they were\\nfiled and the organization thus started on\\na firm legal basis. •\". - rt •\\nWith all obstructions thus removed, the\\nnew .-building was started, the corner\\nstone being laid on July 7, 1863.

Phelps: I beg to submit for;\\nthe benefit of your readers a method\\'\\nof making a small amount of olive oil j\\nfor family use. 1 have followed Hum\\nplan for a number of years with per- j\\nfeel success.\\nWhen picking Hie olives for pickling\\nI leave all the small ones on the trees.;\\nSome time in the next month or two;\\nwhen 1 have leisure 1 go through the\\ngrove again and pick as many of the\\nsmall ones as I wish for oil. I gel\\none gallon id\\' oil from about SO pounds\\nof olives. I spread .the fruit out in\\ndrying trays so that they stand not\\nmore than one inch deep and stack\\nthe trays in Hie shed with strips be\\ntween or stack crossways to allow\\nventilation. They remain thus til!\\nsome time during the winter, when\\nHu- berries have become somewhat\\nshriveled. This part is not necessary,\\nhut they work better when about one\\nquarter dry.\\nSome day in January or February\\nwhen il rains too hard lo work out\\nside 1 make my oil. As the weather\\nis ususaliy cool enough to congeal the\\noil it is necessary to provide some\\nartificial heat. 1 first put a quantity\\nof the berries in a tub of warm wa\\nter. about. 100 degrees, then grind\\nthem through my cider mill into a tub.\\nI have prepared some squares of bur\\nlap about twice the size of (lie crib\\nof my press and pack the crushed\\nolives in the crib in layers with the\\nburlap after the lime honored meth\\nod of building a cheese in a cider\\npress, except that I use no wooden\\nslats between the layers.\\nFor a settling lank 1 take a 10-gal\\nlon olive cask, knock out Hit- bead,\\nhere a half-inch hole in the side near\\nthe hoHoni tor a spigot and stand a\\npiece nf inch gas pipe in il just\\nlong enough lo reach above the side,\\nInin ihi-s tank I put the juice as\\nil comes from the press. When the\\ncheese is as dry as I can get il I\\ntake il from the press, strip the lay\\ners of pomace from the burlap, throw\\nthem iiitn a tub and heat them up\\nwith warm water, not hot, and press\\nthem the seciunt time, after which 1\\nthrow the pomace away.\\n1 usually let the second cheese stand\\nin Ho- press until me next day. forc\\ning down the screw from time to lime.\\nIf my settling tank is not full when\\nI have finished all my olives, I nearly\\nfill il with warm water to facilitate\\nskimming off the oil. pouring Hie wa\\nter from the spout of a teakettle\\nthrough the gas pipe so that the wil\\nier enters Hie bottom without disturb\\ning the oil on the surface.\\nThe juice should he allowed to slam!\\nin the settling tank Iwn or three weeks,\\noccasionally drawing off a few quarts\\nof the liquid from the spigot and re\\nplacing it with warm water through\\nthe pipe. When a considerable depth\\nl of oil has appeared on the surface\\nI skim il 1 iff with a spoon, being care\\nful not to disturb the turbid juice be\\nlow the oil until the last skimming.\\nThen when 1 have got all the clear oil\\nI take about an inch of the juice off\\nand place it in a small open vessel to\\nne skimmed again later.\\nFor tillering the oil 1 use a common\\ntin funnel, lining il with galvanized\\nmosquito netting and using common\\ntiller paper, procurable at any drug\\nstore.\\nI suppose that I get only about half\\nHie oil out of the olives by Ibis meth\\nod. hut what 1 gel is far superior lo\\nanything that can he bought on the\\nmarket. it is the first new virgin\\noil. The last run under heavy hy\\ndraulic pressure is not really til for\\ntable use. lull the manufacturers mix\\nit in with Hie virgin oil, thereby in\\ncreasing the volume at Ihe expense of\\nthe quality.\\nRETAIL EGG PRICES DROP\\nTEN CENTS IN FIVE DAYS\\nEOS AN<SEEKS Dec. 4. —The follow\\ning scale shows how rapidly Ihe whole\\nsale and retail price of eggs has de\\nclined in five days:\\nWholesale.

There has been some uncertainty as to the\\nprospects on the neighboring hill, Lincoln mountain, but this uncer\\ntainty is dissolved by the assay of the 38 inch ore shipped Thursday.\\nThere is now no doubt that Lincoln peak will prove as great a bonanza\\nas Nenzel mountain.\\nThe effect of this announcement has been a rush of prospectors\\nfrom the environs of Nenzel mountain to the lower stretches of the\\nother hill. Work on claims which had not been touched already has\\nstartled, and the activities on the claims near the summit Jjave been\\ndoubled. Tunnels are being pushed in, and shafts sunk, with a vigor\\nthat has not marked a mining camp since Goldfield days. With Lincoln\\npeak showing up as well as Nenzel mountain, the glory that has been\\nTonopah\\'s is sure to crown the new camp, leaving Tonopah second\\nplace in the list of permanent strikes.\\n\"Big , Indian\" Just as It cost money to\\ndrive tunnels through solid rock to\\nreach a vein of ore eight feet distant.\\nOH, THAT PIAXO!\\nIn one saloon which assumes the\\ndignity of a dancing- hall because it\\npossesses a piano, the piano player is\\ntoo far gone from the effects of the\\nnight\\'s business to even see the keys.\\nHe hangs helpless over a barrel, and\\nno amount of coaxing can Induce him\\nto stagger over to the piano and grind\\nout a tune. But the piano does not\\nlack for players. Other fingers can\\n\"tickle the keys.\" and they do. It is\\nnear daylight, but one hour is as good\\nas another in a mining camp where ex\\ncitement runs , high.\\nThere are saloons doing business in\\nthe lower town whose bar tenders can\\nhardly distinguish between the bottle\\nand the cork. The early part of the\\nevening is too strenuous. In one sa\\nloon it is necessary to drag the bar\\ntender away from his\\' berth by the\\nstove. He swears under his breath\\nwhen each member of the party calls\\nfor a different kind of drink. It takes\\na half hour to serve it. but there are\\nno sleeping accommodations to be had\\nat that hour and time must be killed\\nuntil daylight. The saloon is too hos\\npitable to be ignored.\\nSome day the town will settle down\\nto be a staid, business like community.\\nGoldfleld has , ; Leadville did, and Roar\\ning Camp is now a village of such\\nclaims to respectability as a half a\\ndozen churches, a town jail and a.\\n\"squire.\" But, somehow, these towns\\nhave lost their \\\\romance, and that will\\nbe the case with Rochester. As the\\nprospectors become men with hoards\\nof money In the bank, and the leasers\\nwho now care for nothing but their\\nproximity to \"the vein.\" turn their at\\ntention to the town bite and sell lots,\\nwhile their hired men are digging on\\nthe hill, law and order will enter in\\nand less noise will echo from out the\\nsaloon doors. Then another mining\\ncamp will have passed into history, to\\nhave in its stead a shafted, smoke\\nstacked \"city,\" with a depot and a\\nhotel with an elevator in it. and only\\nthe sound of chugging machinery to\\nremind the pioneers of the clicking\\nof the picks of the earlier days.\\nBIG GREEN CAR GIVES\\nGOOD EXPRESS SERVICE\\nMotor Stage From Lovelock\\nDriven 5,000 Miles With\\nout a Single Mishap\\nExpress service from Lovelock to\\nRochester has been established. It is\\nan especial kind of express service,\\nthe modern idea of what a stage line\\nshould be. There is no pair of teame,\\nno driver with gun poised across his\\nknee on the watch for highwaymen—\\njust a speedy, big green car of the\\nChalmers type, with the proprietor\\ndriver at the wheel. This P. D. is a\\nkeen eyed, steady nerved young chap,\\nwho has the record of having , driven\\n5,000 miles back and forth between\\nRochester and Lovelock, with all kinds\\nof freight, human and mineral, with\\nnever an accident to mar the trip along\\nthe treacherous mountain and desert\\nroads.\\nWhen Rochester shall have become a\\nstaid business community there will\\nbe many legends of these days told to\\nregale the successors of the present\\npioneers, and among- these miners\\' tales\\nwill be stories of Oroville Marker, the\\naforementioned P. D., which will be\\nquite Important items in modern auto\\nmobile lore. For there is hardly one\\nof the men who are making fortunes\\nhand over ftet in the Rochester district\\nwho has not made the Irlp from Love\\nlock to Rochester in the \"big green\\ncar , \\' of Marker\\'s, swapping prospects\\nalong the way, or in conversational\\ngambling upon the future of the new\\nmining camp.\\nNO WILDCATTING\\nTO BE ALLOWED\\nJ. T. Donnellan Declares\\nNew Camp Will Stand\\nfor Truth Only\\nJohn T. Donnellan, one of the mining\\nexperts of San Francisco, and one of\\nthe pioneers of Goldfield, expresses\\nhimself as flrm in the belief that Roch\\nester is destined to be one of the great\\nest camps in the Sagebrush state. He\\nsaid yesterday:\\n\"I have been through a half dozen or\\nmore booms since Goldfleld, but there\\nnever has , been any that Impressed me\\nmore than Rochester. The new camp of\\nNevada has as rich and big a surface\\nshowing as any camp I ever saw, and\\nit gives every indication of going down\\nstrong and of becoming another Tono\\npah. It is. evident that this impression\\nprevails elsewhere, for the camp Is at\\ntracting big capital and there Is abun\\ndant money coming in for development\\npurposes\\'.\"\\nMr. Donnellan is the secretary of the\\nRochester Crown Point Mines com\\npany, whose territory is located in the\\nheart of the best part of the camp as\\nfar as developed, and which has also a\\nlong term lease upon a block of the\\nNenzel property, which contains a part\\nof the vein system that has made the\\nXenzel property what it is today.\\nOn the Crown Point ground the com\\npany has attained a depth of 42 feet\\nby shaft, sending the shaft ln # ore all\\nthe way. The ore has been sacked to\\na value of $60 per ton, the lower grades\\nbeing consigned to the\\' dumps for\\nfuture disposition. Mr. Donnellan\\nstates that there are three men now in\\nthe camp bent tipon installing mill fa\\ncilities for the district, and it Is to the\\ncompany\\'s interests to set aside its\\nlower grade ores for milling, as there\\nis no limit set upon the removal of the\\ndumps in the contract of leasing.\\nThe strength of the veins, and the\\nfact that the silver values predominate\\nover the gold, are factors that go to\\nconvince those knowing Rochester that\\nthe camp will be permanent with depth.\\nThe croppings on the Crown Point\\nproperty pan as wide as 40 feet In\\nplaces , , and the croppings are extremely\\nbold, as can be seen by the numerous\\nphotographs in the possession of Mr.\\nDonnellan.\\nThe camp Is attracting , enormous\\ncrowds, and those having , the interests\\nof the district at heart are determined\\nto prevent wildcatting In every way\\npossible. Mr. Donnellan says that all\\nfigure the camp is , good enough when\\ngauged by actual conditions, and there\\nwill not be permitted any orgy of\\nIllegitimate promotions.\\nC.H. M\\'INTOSH HEADS\\nFOUR NEW COMPANIES\\nReady to Finance All Propo\\nsitions That Look Good\\n—And Many Do\\nThe Rochester Mining Development\\ncompany was the first corporation of\\nits kind to put in an appearance in\\nthe Rochester district and was formed\\nfor the purpose of forwarding the min\\ning development of the district by\\nfinancing all likely looking proposi\\ntions that might be brought forward.\\nThis company is the fourth one pro\\nmoted by.C. H. Mclntosh, who has be\\ncome heavily interested in, the camp\\nand who has already formed three com\\npanies to work properties , which he\\nhas taken over. It is a close corpora\\ntion, with Mclntosh as president; J. E.\\nMcCreary, vice president; W. C. Pitt,\\nsecretary and- treasurer. John Cleg\\nhorn, one of the best practical miners\\nin the state, is manager of mine exami\\nnations for the company In the Inves\\ntigations of all properties.\\nMcCreary is a retired oil capitalist of\\nCoalinga, Cal., and is , one of the wealth\\niest \"men Interested In the camp. He\\nhas been associated with Melntosh and\\nPitt in their recent purchases and has\\napparently decided to take up perma\\nnent interests in the camp and stay\\nwith it for better or for worse.\\nThe company was incorporated with\\n100,000 shares of stock at $1 per share\\nand $60,000 was fully subscribed, the\\nbalance, or 40,000 shares, went Into the\\ntreasury.\\nThe purpose of the company is gen\\neral exploration of the Rochester dis\\ntrict and the looking over of all meri\\ntorious propositions. The promotion\\nand building of a mill or mills will\\ncome within the province of this com\\npany.\\nThis company has a department of\\ninformation with reliable information\\nabout the camp for all who seek defi\\nnite mining Information.\\nELY MEN TAKE OVER FIVE\\nCLAIMS FOR $25,000 CASH\\nROCHESTER, March B.—Mining\\nand business men of Ely, Nev., took\\nhold of the Lake View group, compris\\ning five claims, for a consideration of\\n$25,000. The View group, for\\nmerly belonged to Sweeney & Dewitz.\\nThis group is situated on Independence\\nhill, and right in the heart of Roches\\nter. Big surface showings of high\\nvalue stand out prominently, and a\\nstrong vein 5 feet in width is stripped\\nfor 7i feet. The new owners will sink\\na shaft 100 feet in depth Just as fast\\nas they can possibly get around to it.\\nThe group has attracted considerable\\nattention from mining men in general.\\nTEN THOUSAND TONS\\nIN SIGHT IN BIG FOUR\\nOne Lease Alone to Ship Ore\\nfor Years to Come, Is\\nPrediction\\nTen thousand tons of ore In nlpht\\nIn the Big Four leajre on Nenxel peak*\\nwith an eight foot vein running to an\\naverage of $75 to the top, and the tun\\nnel of the Codd lease of th« Rochester\\nHill* Mining company SO feet from th*\\nsame ledge are indications of the pert\\nmanency of the new camp of Rochester\\nand the bona fide support of the boost*\\ning of the last few days. The Big Fou*\\ntunnel has been In ore for many weeks\\nand at last accounts had reached •\\nwidth of 12 feet.\\nThe news has not been of a »n«*\\ntional nature, as the direct result*\\nprophesied by those familiar ■with the\\noutcroppings on Nenzel peak have ooma\\nto pass. The vein has widened and\\nthe ore has become richer in lt« down\\nward course and there is now not the\\nslightest doubt that the Rochester\\nHills Mining company on the Codd\\nlease will strike the same ledge at the\\nsame if not richer values.\\nThe conclusions from the develop*\\nments of the last week are simply to\\nthe effect that the camp is assured of\\nshipping ore for years from these two\\nleases alone, and this conclusion is\\nreached in spite of the fact that devel\\nopment work has Just begun.\\nIn addition to the siiowlngs on these\\ntwo properties, which may have been,\\nand promise to be the mainstay of the\\ncamp, there are some excellent find\\nings on other leases on the Crown\\nPoint No. 1, besides many important\\ndiscoveries of the last week on ether\\nproperties of the district.\\nVBRINGTOX COPPER MOTES\\nThe Yerington Mountain Copper com\\npany, operating about 12 miles east of\\nYerington, has Its spur track on the\\nNevada-California road, this side of\\nSchurz, completed and Is putting In ore\\nbins at an expense of about $2,000.\\nWhen these are completed the property\\nwlll be a heavy producer. Several thou\\nsand tons of ore are now piled on th»\\ndump at the mine awaiting hauling to\\nthe railroad to be shipped to the smel\\nter. This ore was all taken out In de\\nvelopment work and the property is\\nproving - to be one of the big onea of\\nthis district.\\nW. B. Boulter rave C. W.

Believing the\\nlong trip overland, or the other two routes around\\nCape Horn or across the Isthmus of Panama, were too\\ndifficult, this man went by boat to Galveston, thence\\noverland across Texas and Mexico to the west coast\\nand up the coast by ship to Santa Barbara.\\nThe journey required several months and those\\nwho made it suffered terrible hardships. More than\\na score perished on the way from cholera, while hostile\\nIndians and other dangers menaced the party at all\\ntimes. Even these hardships were not comparable,\\nthe agonaut wrote, to the tediousness of the long slow\\ntrip.\\nContrasting his experience with that of Captain\\nHawks shows the progress that has been made. Aside\\nfrom the natural fatigue one would have from a long\\nday’s w’ork, or even driving an automobile, Hawks suf\\nfered no hardship. He made the entire distance in the\\nsame time that would enable the argonaut to make 40\\nmiles if all went w’ell.\\nIn spite of ail that has been and will be written\\nabout forest fires, thousands of acres of California\\ntimber land are doubtless doomed to be destroyed this\\nsummer, causing- a heavy monetary loss and a scenic\\nloss that cannot be calculated.\\nSome of this waste it is not possible to prevent, but\\nstatistics show\\' that the great majority of forest fires\\nare caused by carelessness. Campers fail to extinguish\\ntheir fires, smokers throw cigar and cigarette butts\\naway; matches are carelessly dropped into dry leaves.\\nEach year a strenuous campaign is carried on by\\nstate authorities and semi-public organizations, urging\\nthe public to use the greatest care with fire when they\\nare near timbered country.\\nValley residents can w\\'ell recall the fires of last\\nyear which destroyed hundreds of acres of land in the\\nmountains west of us. The scars left by the fire are\\nstill to be seen. Fires have already been reported\\nthis season in these mountains.\\nOur county has no timber land to be destroyed\\nbut the anti-fire propaganda applies just as strongly to\\nus as to residents in any other part of the state, perhaps\\nm.oreso. Having no forests of our own to guard, we\\nmay be tempted into carelessness when visiting tim\\nbered areas ip other parts of the state.\\nStrict compliance with the forestry regulations\\nwhen visiting the w\\'ooded sections should be the aim of\\nevery valleyite this summer. It may be something of\\na hardship to have to refrain from smoking while visit\\ning summer resorts, but those in charge of the forests\\nknow that it is absolutely necessary to safety.\\nCareful watching of camp fires, matches and\\nsmoking material will do much to avoid disaster.\\nFigures published in the news column of this issue,\\nshow without doubt that El Centro needs another\\nartery through its business section to relieve the heavy\\ntraffic across the railroad tracks at Commercial and\\nMain streets.\\nThey indicate that during the noon hour in one\\nday, an average of 10 vehicles cross the tracks at\\nMain street each minute. A total of nearly 8,000\\nvehicles crossed during a 24 hour period. These fig\\nures may not seem so astounding now, but they are as\\nlow as they ever will be. That they will be much\\nhigher a few years hence is not to be doubted.\\nCommercial street crossing figures were some\\nwhat lower nearly 2,000 vehicles crossing the tracks.\\nAt Main street, during the checking period, 177 trains\\ncrossed over the highway; at Commercial street the\\nfigure was 319.\\nThe object of the check was to obtain reliable and\\naccurate figures on traffic for use of the state railroad\\ncommission, which is to give a decision in the near\\nfuture on the plan to extend State street across the\\nrailroad.\\nSince Eighth street was paved, commercial traf\\nfic through State street has increased heavily. Traf\\nfic headed into the city is practically all destined for\\nthe industrial section on the east side, and must be\\ndetoured either to Main street or to Orange street be\\nfore it gets there. A cut through to the east Bide on\\nState street will relieve the burden on Main street by\\na goodly percentage now and by a much heavier per\\ncentage in the future.

We must consider that most\\nof our bind, due to a lack of fertili\\nzation, docs well to produce one nor\\nmal crop. Isn’t it expecting a lot\\n(to assume that any klud of land,\\nanywhere, will, within the usual six\\nmonths’ tilling, planting_and grow\\ning season, produce enough to war\\nrant a layoff during the balance of\\nthe year? Is there imv business\\n(lint will produce sufficiently and\\nwill progress and prosper without\\nthe continued application of a good\\ndeal of brain and brawn.\\nIn the middle west, forage and ]\\ngrain are used to a very great ex\\ntent in finishing some form of live\\nstock, thus the fnrmer has all occu\\npation —in fact, that is the method\\nof marketing the bulk of the pro\\nduction; namely, through the modi\\num of live stock. It not only fur\\nnishes employment hut it is re\\ngarded as an essential part of farm\\ning and the live stock feature is\\ngenerally considered as the chance\\nfor profit or loss.

EDITH HOOK, FORMER EL CENTRO\\nWOMAN, WRITES A VIVID ACCOUNT OF\\ntrip to mt. McKinley in Alaska\\nThe many friends of Dr. Edith M.\\nHook will be greatly interested in\\nreading the contents of a, recent let\\nter received by Mrs. Mabel Edgar of\\nImperial from Dr. Hook. Dr. Hook,\\nwho practiced in El Centro for sev\\neral years, left last summer for an\\nAlaskan trip and was so charmed\\nwith the country that she opened up\\nan office in Anchorage where she\\nhas been practicing ever since. Her\\nmother has been with her part of the\\nyear but has returned again to Cali\\nfornia. It is understood that Dr.\\nHook plans to return to Southern\\nCalifornia possibly late in the sum\\nmer.\\nHer letter describes in detail a\\ntrip to Mt. McKinley, the highest\\npeak in North America, and is so\\nlengthy that it will apperfr in two\\nsections, the second section appear\\ning in tomorrow’s issue of the\\nPress.\\nHero letter follows herewith:\\nI never spent such an interesting\\nwinter in my life. But the days are\\ngetting longer now, the sub hot set\\nting until 7:30 and twilight still\\nlingering until 9:00, so maybe we\\ncan crowd a few\\' more things into\\nthe 24 hours.\\nI have just returned from Mt. Mc-\\nKinley National park where ! spent\\na most delightful two weeks with\\nsome friends of mine, so I’ll tell you\\nall about it.\\nDr. Gregory, Mrs. Gregory, Mr.\\nPaul Borak and myself made up the\\nparty. We went through the park,\\nby dog team, being the first tour\\nists to have gone through in the\\nwinter time. Mr. Borak had been\\nin the region seven years ago hunt\\ning and trapping, just before it was\\nmade a national park. He mushed\\nthe dogs for us, being experienced\\nin that line.\\nOf course it was really the first\\nof April when we went, but since\\nthe ice and snow and glacier forma\\ntions were still very much in evi\\ndence, we eall it winter time until\\nsummer and its manifestations have\\ncome, which same arrives sometime\\nin June in the park. ,\\nAnchorage is called the California\\nof Alaska because of the mildness\\nof its winters as compared to other\\nparts of Alaska, so the day was\\nbright and beautiful, with not a\\ncloud in the sky when we left here.\\nOur journey lay through the heart\\nof Alaska and the greater part of\\ntwo days was consumed in going\\nfrom here to Mt. McKinley park.\\nWe passed through Matanuska\\ndistrict which boasts the best farm\\ning land in Alaska; Wasilla, where.\\n■\\nA\\ndistinguished coffee\\nmeets many\\ndistinguished people\\nIt is the glorious West that visitors from\\nabroad most want to see in America. Not\\nthe least of the thrills they relate back home\\nis that “wonderful western coffee!” And\\nthus has +he coffee tradition spread to every\\nOld World capital.\\nYou know their enthusiasm is well founded\\nthe moment you break the vacuum seal of\\na tin of Hills Bros. Red Can Coffee and re\\nlease that rare aroma. You are doubly sure\\nwhen you taste the flavor. As one zealot\\nsaid, “They may copy the can, but not its\\ncontents 1”\\nWith all its high quality, Hills Bros.\\nCoffde is not high-priced. It is economical to\\nbuy—and economical to use.

McKinley, the high\\nest peak on the North American eon\\ntinent, 20,300 feet in elevation. The\\nimpression is that it is much higher,\\nthe surrounding mountains being on\\na low level, only a little above sea\\nlevel.\\nWe stayed all night at Curry hotel\\nwhich is a very modern, up to date,\\ncomfortable hotel.\\nThe next morning was still, clear\\nand beautiful when we boarded the\\ntrian at S o’clock.\\nWe reached the deep snow belt\\nnow and the snow-plow went ahead\\nof the train to clear the track of\\nsnow many feet deep. The ther\\nmometer was below’ zero and a strong\\nwind was blowing which piled the\\nsnow in drifts. 1 ,\\nScenery Surpasses Alps\\nThe scenery was great and far sur\\npasses anything in the Canadian\\nRockies or the Swiss Alps, it is said.\\nTall snow covered mountains and\\ndeep snow drifted cayons, (among\\nthem Hurrycane Gulch 350 feet\\ndeep and as many wide, which re\\nminded me of Carisso Gorge except\\nfor the snow), and many rivers\\nstill frozen and white, all left im\\npressions on the mind not to be for\\ngotten soon.\\nSection houses we passed, with\\nonly their roofs showing above the\\nsnow and having a cleared space\\nonly at the station where a small bag\\nof mail and provisions were thrown\\noff to the waiting populace.\\nFor two jiours in the afternoon we\\nwere halted while the snowplow\\ntackled an especially stubborn drift.\\nArriving at Mt. McKinley Park\\n■station we were met by Mr. H. P.\\nKarstens, the park superintendent,\\nwith a horse-drawn sled to take, ns\\nto his home.\\nMr. Karstens, with one other man.\\nholds the distinction of being the\\nonly ones who have climbed Mt. Mc-\\nKinley to its top, taking three\\nmonths to climb and three days to\\ndescend. He is an old “sourdough” j\\nand pioneer of Alaska, first coming\\nto this country during the gold rush\\ndays of the Klondyke, in J 879. He,\\nthen was a boy of 20. Being a ■\\nstrong, well built, young man of six\\nfeet height, he came into promi\\nnence on the Chilkoot Pass, (a steep\\nrugged climb from Dyen to the sum\\nmit), as a packer. He made hun\\ndreds of trips up and down this pass,\\ncarrying a pack of 125 pounds on\\nhis back at one dollar a pound.\\nAfter making a little ‘‘stake”\\nho proceeded on into the Klondyke\\nami the Sevcnly-Milc country, so\\ncalled because of a river 70 miles\\nlong running through it. Here he\\nwas nicknamed ‘‘The Seventy Mile\\nKid. ’ ’\\nIn 1903, the year of the Fair\\nbanks stampede, he went to the in\\nterior where he was a. prospector,\\nhunter, trader and trapper the ma\\njority of which he did in the region\\nthat is now Mt. McKinley National\\npark.\\nWear Many Clothes\\nWe stayed with Mr. and Mrs.\\nKarstens two days, enjoying true\\nAlaskan hospitality, before going on\\nby dog team to our camp 15 miles\\naway. The man used the two days\\nto break trail, taking some of the\\nprovisions with them, one snow\\nshoeing ahead of the dogs, the other\\n‘‘mushing” the dogs over the trail\\nmade.\\nThe thermometer was still below\\nzero by 20 degrees with the wind as\\nstrong as ever.\\nThey cached the groceries seven\\nmiles up, returning that night, ami\\ngoing on next day the rest of the\\nway ami returning again for Mrs.\\nGregory ami me.\\nOn the third day we all started\\nout for camp, our sled loaded down\\nwith the remaining provisions and\\nMrs. Gregory, who couldn’t walk\\nthe 15 miles. We were all bundled\\nup to the cars. I, for instance, hav\\ning on wool trousers, four sweaters,\\na fur coat, five pair of hose, (two\\nnext the skin of silk, then one pair\\nof silk and wool and the last two\\npair of wool) inside my shoe pacs\\nbeside the insoles to the pacs, tw’o\\npair of wool gloves, a fur cap and\\neverything else I could get on too,\\nand then did not feel any too heav\\nily clad.\\nWe had a dog team of seven male- |\\nmute dogs, big, fine fellows all I\\ncreamy white and all brothers or\\'\\nhalf brothers.\\nThe leaders name was Boatswain ;\\nor “B’o’s’a’n”, named that, no I\\ndoubt, because with the aid of the 1\\nfirst mate, or leader, the Captain or i\\n“musher” of the team was able i\\nto drive the ship or sled along to\\nsafety. Then came Whity and Runt,\\nHunter and Sandy, Red and Cay\\nenne, all being harnessed in pairs\\nexcept the leader.\\nThese dogs are very intelligent•\\nand can do everything but talk.\\nThey are very jealous of attentions I\\ngiven them and if you pet one you ■\\nmust pet all.

V. Allen, California supervisor\\nof Farm Placement Service for the\\nUnited States Department of Labor.\\nMr. Allen, whose department has\\ngiven splendid cooperation in seek\\ning to stem the tide of indigent,\\nadvises that: “From current infor\\nmation received from the Border\\nCheck Station Inspectors, there\\nseem to be a good many migrants\\nleaving California at the present\\ntime and very few entering the\\nstate \"\\nThat report—if the trend con\\ntinues—is of vital importance to all\\nCalifornia, but of even greater im\\nportance to rural California, for\\nMr. Allen’s study of the Dust Bowl\\ninvasion also reveals that most of\\nthe migrants have settled in fann\\ning areas and have become a\\nburden on farm taxpayers as well\\nas a contributing cause to farm\\nlabor difficulties.\\nIndicative of the importance of\\nthe migrant problem to California\\nagriculture, Mr. Allen makes this\\nsignificant analysis: “Of the 90,740\\nout-of-state persons actually count\\ned at the borders as entering the\\nstate of California in search of\\nwork during 1937, 78.332, or 86.3 per\\ncent, were farm laborers migrat\\ning from the middle west drought\\nstates.”\\nVALLEY REPUBLICANS\\nATTEND DINNER\\nThree members of the Imperial\\nCounty Republican Central com\\nmittee attended a dinner for Gover\\nnor Frank Merriam and Dr. W.

A. Ascuith, of the Bureau of\\nEntomology, made the study to de\\ntermine what, type of insects had\\nattacked the cotton plants, then\\nexperimented with a series of dust\\nings which completely eradicated\\nthe insects.\\nAscuith learned that four types\\nof bugs had bored into the cotton\\ncrop and had caused rathei- heavy\\nlosses, especially in the Bard sec\\ntion.\\nThe lygiis, the creontiades, the\\nbrown cotton bug and the big green\\nstink bug, caused the most trouble\\nin the cotton, Ascuith revealed.\\nThe creontiades left the alfalfa\\nfields and traveled to the cotton\\nearly in June, Ascuith determined\\nin his study. Later in June the ly\\ngus left alfalfa, the brown cotton\\nbug migrated in July and green\\nstink bug moved to cotton when all\\nalfalfa had bee harvested.\\nExperiments carried on by the\\nentomologist revealed that cotton\\nyields could be increased as much\\nas 900 pounds to the acre by dust\\ning.\\nIt is necessary, however, to apply\\na series of dustings for results.\\nInstructions must be followed to\\nthe letter, Ascuith said, or the\\ncause will be lost.\\nWater Facilities\\nProgram Data\\nAvailable\\nPreliminary information concern\\ning the new water facilities pro\\ngram of the U.

G. Goar, super\\nintendent of the University of California Experiment\\nStation, El Centro. Goar relieves tne valley flax growers\\nhave established at least two new world records in flax-\\nseed production this year to be\\nadded to the individual grower rec\\nord set up last year by Keith Mets,\\nHoltville, when he produced 46\\nbushels per acre on 13 acres, and\\naveraged 32 bushels per acre on\\nmore than 400 acres.\\nThis was a two-way world record\\nfor commercial flax. Forty-six bush\\nels per acre is the highest yield yet\\nrecorded from a commercial plant\\ning, and an average yield of 32\\nbushels per acre on more than 400\\nacres by one grower is also un\\nprecedented.\\nMets Holds 1938 Record\\nMets continues to lead in produc\\ntion in 1938 with an average yield\\nof 39.67 bushels per acre on 106\\nacres. Included in this 106 acres\\nwere 20 acres that averaged 43.4\\nbushels per acre; 40 acres that\\naveraged 39.2 bushels; 11 acres that\\naveraged 38.3 bushels and 35 acres\\nthat averaged 38.5 bushels.

Gov. George J.\\nHatfield told guests and members of the\\nEl Centro Business and Professional\\nWomen’s clubs why he believes the fed\\neral constitution needs no new amend\\nments. His reasoning was clearcut and\\nconcise, and would need a lot of rebut\\nting to change the minds of listeners.\\nThe Federal constitution, he said, has\\nbeen acclaimed as the greatest instru\\nment ever struck off by the hand of\\nman. The world’s most famous author\\nities concur in this opinion. It was not\\nthe result only of one particular meet\\ning, but the outgrowth of centuries of\\nexperience throughout the previous his\\ntory of England. Faced with opportunity\\nto create what they felt was the most\\nperfect government possible, and un\\nhampered by great accumulations of\\nlaws and statutes, the leaders of the\\nthirteen colonies drew upon England’s\\nexperience and inculcated in their docu\\nment, the best possible checks and bal\\nances. The majority of the people of\\nthis country feel the constitution needs\\nno changing. Under its clauses, it per\\nmits the greatest possible liberty with\\nthe greatest possible safety. If freedom\\nof action is to be increased for executive\\nor legislative or judicial bodies, some\\nthing must be sacrificed and obviously,\\nthis means weakening the safety provi\\nsions. In the previous history of this\\ncountry it has not been found necessary\\nto alter continually the constitution and\\nwe do not believe it is necessary now.\\nThere may be some more profound argu\\nments in favor of changing the consti\\ntution than has come our way, and if so\\neveryone should listen carefully and\\nweigh the testimony. It would, however,\\ntake a deal of evidence and a long time\\nto consider it, before this country should\\nembark upon such a risky business as\\nchanging the very foundation stones of\\nthe nation’s structure.\\no\\nIn an Ethiopian air raid scene, the\\ncross that marks the spot seems usually\\nto be a red one.\\nThe People’s Voice\\nLetters should be limited to 150 words\\non problems rather than personalities.

My. boy isn’t a crook\\nin any sense of the word.

Roosevelt.\\nTHE PRESIDENT SHOULD\\nLET THE HON US HILL PASS\\nWednesday, the new compromise\\nbonus bill is scheduled to come up be\\nfore the House of Representatives.\\nDoubtless it will pass by a heavy vote.\\nThe next move is up to President Roose\\nvelt and, to be consistent, he will prob\\nably veto it with or without expression\\nof reasons. These reasons have been ex\\npressed before and they are good. Brief\\nly summarized, they are (1) that pay\\nment of the bonus represents the ability\\nof a minority to force an expense on the\\nmajority; (2) That as an aid to the de\\npression, it is not properly discrimina\\ntory because it distributes funds equally\\nto all veterans whether they need the\\nmoney or not. We believe however, that\\nhis viewpoint is not entirely correct. In\\nthe first place, this is not a decision to\\ngive the veterans a bonus. That decision\\nwas made long since, when congress\\ndec’ded the men who were in service\\ndeserved more recompense than they\\nreceived. They were not given cash, how\\never, but were given certificates in the\\nnature of promissory notes, to be paid\\nin full if the veteran lived long enough\\nand if he didn’t use up the loan value.\\nThe present decision of congress is one\\nof whether these notes, as it were, should\\nbe paid now in the form of bonds which,\\nif the veteran is not in need, may be\\nretained indefinitely, but which, if the\\nveteran is in need, can be cashed and the\\nmoney received spent and put into circul\\nation. Various communities already are\\nestimating the amount of cash which\\nwould start flowing. Such money would\\nperform several duties with the same\\ndollars. It would provide relief benefits\\nhi many cases, pay off an obligation, and\\nspeed up business. It is hoped the Pres\\nident either signs the bill or lets it pass\\nwithout signature, thus doing away with\\nthis troublesome problem.\\no\\n“Dead Canadian Breathes.” On the\\nother hand, a friend of ours was living,\\nyet not breathing, after dropping a shoe\\nabout 4 a. m., New Year’s Day.\\noo\\nA Bostonian, who recently suffered\\nfrom a lapse of memory, will run for\\nsenator on a Townsend plank.

Considerable increase\\nfor all kinds of livestock produc\\ntion chiefly to improve living\\nstandards.\\nGREAT PLAINS AND PACIFIC\\nNORTHWEST WHEAT REGIONS:\\nDecrease in pre-AAA wheat acre\\nage; removal of low-yield ‘wheat\\nland from production. Increases\\nof feed production in hard winter\\nwheat, spring wheat, and Pacific\\nNorthwest areas.\\nRANGE REGION: Chiefly, a\\nslight decrease in number of cat\\ntle from the low level prevailing\\nin either 1930 or 1935, with in\\ncrease of hay production to pro\\nvide more winter feed.
